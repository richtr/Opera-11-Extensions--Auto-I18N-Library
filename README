 OEX Auto Localization Library
 -------------------------------
 -------------------------------
 
 The auto-translation library for Opera 11+ extension developers provides a convenient
 way for developers to include multi-language support within their extensions.
 
 Follow these simple instructions to setup and use this auto-localization library from
 your Popup and/or Injected Script files:
 
 --------------------------
 Pre-defined Localization:
 --------------------------
 
 1. Include the following line in your Background process (typically /index.html):
 
 		<script type="text/javascript" src="translate.js"></script>
 
 2. Create your reference strings in /messages.js (see /messages.js for more details)
 
 3. Copy and paste the /snippet.js file once in to your Popup or Injected Script target 
    files.
 
 4. In this file, then load either ALL localized versions of your reference strings 
    from messages.js...
 
  	loadLocale();
  
    ...OR, load only a sub-set of the localized versions of your reference strings 
    using a pre-defined scope (more details in /messages.js):
  
  	loadLocale( 'popupStrings' );
  	loadLocale( 'injectedStrings' );
  
    You can use an *optional* callback to determine when the localized messages have 
    been returned:
    
     	loadLocale( 'popupStrings', function(toLanguage, localizedMessages) {
     		opera.postError('Translated messages to ' + toLanguage);
     		// ...your initialization code here.
     	});
     
    ...OR, you could just use a callback without including a scope:
    
    	loadLocale( function(toLanguage, localizedMessages) {
			opera.postError('Translated messages to ' + toLanguage);
     		// ...your initialization code here.
    	});
 
 5. Once this process has completed, access the your localized messages are available 
    by their *id* as follows within Javascript:
 
 		_message['welcomeMessage'];
 		_message['helpButtonString'];
		// etc...
 
 That's all you need for complete auto-localization of your extension.
 
 ------------------------
 On-demand Localization:
 ------------------------
 
 In addition to localizing your pre-defined strings from messages.js, this library also 
 provides an on-demand localization/translation feature for Opera 11 extensions.
 
 To use the on-demand localization feature, follow these instructions:
 
 1. Once again, make sure that translate.js is included in your Background process page 
    (typically in index.html):
 
 		<script type="text/javascript" src="translate.js"></script>
 
 2. Copy and paste the /snippet.js file once in to your Popup or Injected Script target 
    files.
 
 3. Perform on-demand translation/localization with the following code:
 
 		localize(
 			'en', // The language code of the strings below.
 			{
 				'id': 'mystring1',
 				'string': 'string 1 to translate'
 			},
 			{
 				'id': 'mystring2',
 				'string': 'string 2 to translate'
 			}, 
 			{
 				'id': 'mystring3',
 				'string': 'string 3 to translate'
 			},
 			// include as many strings here as you like...
 			{
 				'id': 'mystring4',
 				'string': '...etc...'
 			},
 			// *Mandatory* translation callback function:
 			function( toLanguage, translatedStrings ) {
				opera.postError('Translated messages to ' + toLanguage);
				// Process resulting translations here
 			}
 		);
 
 4. Use the callback to determine when and whether your strings could be translated to 
    the user's locale.

** IT IS QUICKER TO USE THE FIRST METHOD TO OBTAIN TRANSLATIONS. THE SECOND METHOD **
** SENDS AN INDIVIDUAL TRANSLATION REQUEST TO THE SERVERS EACH TIME THIS FUNCTION  ** 
** IS CALLED. WHERE POSSIBLE YOU SHOULD PRE-DEFINE YOUR MESSAGES IN messages.js.   **
**                                                                                 **
